<!-- literally spent the majority of test time working out a bug on my second feature (add goal). know i didn't build enough features to pass, but am proud of fixing it at the last moment! main.js line 34 i had goal capitalized, which when accessing the value in controller.js line 36, was returning undefined. -->
